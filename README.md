## Problem 1
Goal: 
1) Wrote a code that gives a graph of an SIR model for different value of beta and gamma. 
2) In the SRC folder is where the python file is.
3) The data folder is where the graphs (the output from the python file) are.
## Results from problem 1:
1) Case: Beta is 1 and Gamma is 0.5
2) Case: Beta is 1.5 and Gamma is 0.5
3) Case: Beta is 2 and Gamma is 0.5
