## Problem 1
Goal: 
1) Wrote a code that gives a graph of an SIR model for different value of beta and gamma. 
2) In the SRC folder is where the python file is.
3) The data folder is where the graphs (the output from the python file) are.
## Results from problem 1:
1) Case: Beta is 1 and Gamma is 0.5
2) Case: Beta is 1.5 and Gamma is 0.5
3) Case: Beta is 2 and Gamma is 0.5

## Problem 3 
Part b: Created plots for R0 using the fsolve function in python. Each plot was a scatter plot and f(r_infinity) and g(r_infinity) were graphed on the same graph.

Part d: Tested the predictions that the figures from part b gave for a beta value of 1 and a gamma value of 0.5. The final prediction worked as there was a disease curve for infection, and was looking for a r_infinity value of greater than zero which is what was obtained.

## Problem 4
Created a graph for when R0 is equal to one, R0 is less than one (stable) and R0 is greater than one (unstable). These R0 value were used to graph what the infection curves will look like.
