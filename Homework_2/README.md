# Infectious Disease Homework 2 
## Problem 1
The goal of this problem was to look at the effects of step size. 
## Problem 1a 
A forward Euler method was created for an SIS model to compare I(t) to the analytical solution.

 ## Problem 1c 
 The maximum absolute error was calculated using a certain delta T

 ## Problem 1d
 A logarithmic plot was creared to show the relationship between the delta t and the absolute maximum error.

## Problem 2C 
Problem 2 looked into vaccines and how vaccine efficacy can be used to model the leaky model and the all or nothing model for vaccines. The leaky model and all or nothing model were modeled based on the SIR model shown for the population size of 300,000.
